Design and Architecture of Chirp!

Domain model
Insert UML class diagram.


Architecture - In the small
Make illustration of the Onion and what resides inside it.

For the Chirp! program we have implemented the Onion-Architecture structure. The structure is built up in layers: Core, Infrastructure and Web. The Core layer being completely independent of the other layers. The Infrastructure layer does not depend on the web application layer either. 
The layers use Data Transfer Objects (DTO's) to communicate and transfer data from the center of the onion and outwards.
